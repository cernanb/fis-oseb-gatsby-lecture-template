# Our Programs

Flatiron School currently offers career-focused programs across three different disciplines: Software Engineering, Data Science, and UI/UX Design. Software Engineering and Data Science currently include both in-person immersive programs and online programs. The Design program currently includes both online and immersive components. This section focuses on our exclusively online programs.

The in-person immersive programs are currently based in New York City (Manhattan), Brooklyn (Access Labs), DC, Houston, London, Atlanta and Seattle campuses. Online programs include students from around the world.

## Online Software Engineering Bootcamp (OSEB)

Our Online Software Engineering Bootcamp is offered as a Full-time (FT), Part-time (PT) or Self-paced (SP) course that can be completed from anywhere. You can read a more detailed description of this offering from the public website here: https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/online/
**Online Web Development Program (FSWD)** - This is a previous iteration of the OSEB self-paced program, internally referred to as Full Stack Web Development (FSWD). This program is being phased out, however there is still a large community of currently enrolled students completing this version of the program. We tend to refer to these students as “legacy students”.

## Online Data Science Bootcamp (ODSB)

Our Online Data Science Bootcamp is offered as a Full-time (FT), Part-time (PT) or Self-paced (SP) course that can be completed from anywhere. You can read a more detailed description of this offering from the public website here: https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-data-science-bootcamp/

## Program Guides

It is important for you to carefully read the program guides (linked below) that are applicable to your students. They are shared with the students when they begin the program and detail: the students’ support team; curriculum overviews; instructional resources; benefits; contact information; and other key information. You are responsible for being thoroughly familiar with all of these aspects of each program so that you can provide consistent information and resources to students. Although there are many similarities in the overall structure of the programs, there are also many differences (especially in support services).
